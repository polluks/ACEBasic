Buffered File I/O Optimization
===============================

Branch: buffered-file-io

Step 1: fgetline() with Read + Seek
------------------------------------
[x] Create branch buffered-file-io
[x] Add Read/Seek declarations to fgets.c
[x] Replace fgetline() body with bulk Read + Seek
[x] Build runtime on emulator (make -f Makefile-lib clean all)
[x] Test with verify/tests/cases/fileio/buffered_io.b
[x] Run benchmark examples/benchmarks/fileio.b (9846 lines/sec)
[x] Run full test suite (192 pass, 1 pre-existing failure)

Status: Step 1 COMPLETE. Committed as dc0c410.

Step 2: fgets() and fgetchars() with bulk Read
-----------------------------------------------
[x] Replace fgets() body with Read + Seek (same pattern as fgetline, keeps \n)
[x] Replace fgetchars() body with single Read() call
[x] Build runtime on emulator (make -f Makefile-lib clean all)
[x] Test with verify/tests/cases/fileio/buffered_io.b (via full suite)
[x] Run benchmark examples/benchmarks/fileio.b (12190 lines/sec, up from 9846)
[x] Run full test suite (193 pass, 0 fail, 0 skip)

Status: Step 2 COMPLETE. Committed as 1070779.

Step 3: fgetseqfld() with bulk Read + Seek
-------------------------------------------
[x] Replace fgetseqfld() body with Read + Seek (same pattern as Steps 1-2)
[x] Build runtime on emulator (make -f Makefile-lib clean all) - OK
[x] Test: 75 PASS, 0 FAIL - OK
[x] Benchmark: INPUT# 4129 records/sec - REGRESSION from 4923 baseline (~16% slower)
[x] Reverted to original fgetc()-based implementation

Status: Step 3 ABANDONED. Bulk Read+Seek is unsuitable for fgetseqfld() because
fields are short (5-15 bytes) and fgetc() already benefits from AmigaDOS's internal
208-byte read buffer. The Read(n-1)+Seek overhead exceeds the fgetc() call overhead
for short fields.
