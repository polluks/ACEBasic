 Preface

 My name is @{"Daniel Seifert" LINK finalcomments}. Perhaps some of you remember me from NAP,
 a preprocessor I wrote for the ACE language.
 @{"Herbert Breuer" LINK finalcomments}, who developed the 2.x versions of AIDE until v 2.11,
 has asked me to continue his work on AIDE. Of course I couldn't have
 said "no" ;-) as this is an interesting experience for me.
 Although  Herbert gave  AIDE  to me, he is still having a look at it
 for me  not making  any bad mistakes :-)  We work close together and
 you  might still  @{"address him" LINK finalcomments}  if you have any questions concerning
 AIDE.

 I hope to be able to continue Herberts wonderful work in a good way.
 Thanks in advance for your help and support.

 Introduction

 AIDE stands for  "ACE Integrated Development Environment".  It  is a
 @{"freely  distributable" LINK finalcomments}  graphical  front-end  for the  development of
 ACE programs.  By using AIDE you will never need again to start from
 a shell when developing ACE programs (although you may @{"spawn a shell" LINK spawnshell}
 by selecting an item from AIDE's Project Menu.

 System Requirements

 AIDE requires at least AmigaOS Release 2.04. There is no chance that
 it will run on any lower OS release.
 AIDE will be comfortable with 0.5 megabyte RAM.  (But  ACE might get
 trouble then) AIDE does use only 4096 bytes of stack and does set up
 a stack size of 40000 bytes for any process run by it (esp. ACE will
 be very grateful ;-)

@node install "Setting up"
@TOC TOC

 Setting up

 Before starting  AIDE  for the first time however, you must have ACE
 installed correctly with the following corresponding directories:

        ACE:
        ACE:AIDE        (put at least the AIDE icon, e.g. AIDE.info,
                         here)
        ACE:bin
        ACElib:         (ACE:lib)
        ACEinclude:     (ACE:include)
        ACEbmaps:       (ACE:bmaps)

        (see "ACE.txt"/@{"ACE.guide" LINK ACE:docs/ACE.guide/MAIN} for the details)

 If these dirs aren't set up correctly, AIDE will abort with an error
 message.  Same  if  one  of the following files are not in the right
 directory:

        mrt.library     (in LIBS:)
        thinpaz.font    (in FONTS:)     (These files are included
                                         within this package)

 I recommend to have the following directories as well:

        ACE:Docs        where all the docs reside
        ACE:Icons       where the necessary icons for ACE should be
        ACE:Mods        where your compiled SubMods reside

                        ATTENTION:
                        Subdirectories are not allowed!  Please  copy
                        all  your modules into  ACE:Mods/,  otherwise
                        the modules will not be available.

        ACE:examples        where your source code resides
        ACE:run         where your executables are going
        ACE:temp        where your temporary files during compilation
                        are going

                        ATTENTION:
                        "ACE:temp/"  is  the  DEFAULT  directory  for
                        temporary files during compilation.  To  save
                        memory  they are not any longer stored in  T:
                        (if the default would be T: and T: resides in
                        memory  the source file would be two times in
                        memory) As memory's always short, it's better
                        to have the temporary dir on HD  and  not  in
                        RAM:. Change this to your personal taste.

        ACE:utils       where all the ACE related utilities reside
                        --> ACE:Utils/ACEcalc/Acecalc
                            ACE:Utils/ReqEd/ReqEd
                            ACE:Utils/FD2BMAP/FD2BMAP
                            ACE:Utils/AB2ASCII/AB2ASCII
                            ACE:Utils/UppercACEr/UppercACEr

 If those dirs do not exist, AIDE's internal @{"configuration" LINK configuration} part gives
 you the possibility to do the @{"setup" LINK setup} to your personal need.
@endnode

@node Configuration
@TOC TOC

 Configuration

 AIDE will create a new file called AIDE2.config to run properly.  If
 you've old config files from AIDE 1.5 and before, your settings will
 be copied to the new file.  You  can  later delete the old files, if
 you  wish.  You  can not  edit the new file anymore,  just  use  the
 integrated @{"setup" link setup} part in AIDE.

 No AIDE2.config is included in the AIDE archive.  If  there does not
 exist one, AIDE will create one with the default settings.

 If all the directories exist, @{"as mentioned above" LINK install},  AIDE will create
 the setup in this way  that you do not need to setup  these settings
 manually.  Only for options like PubScreen, Requester, ...  you need
 to open the @{"setup window" LINK setup}, anything else is already done.

 As  AIDE  has no built-in editor  you have to specify your favourite
 one (cmp. @{"setup" link setup}, otherwise "C:Ed" is used ...)
 Note, that the specified editor  MUST  be capable of taking command-
 line  arguments  (e.g. a file name).  Same  applies  to  the  viewer
 (default: AmigaGuide/Multiview).

@node menu "AIDE's menus"
@TOC TOC

 AIDE's menus

 There exist three pull-down menus in AIDE:  Project,  Utilities  and
 Help.  The  Project menu is for  general  house-keeping  tasks,  the
 Utilities  menu  provides  access to a number of useful programs and
 the  Help menu  gives you access to  documentation for the compiler,
 assembler, linker and the ACE language.

 Project menu
  � @{"Open ..." LINK open}
  � @{"View ..." LINK view}
  � @{"Rename ..." LINK rename}
  � @{"Copy ..." LINK copy}
  � @{"Delete ..." LINK delete}
  � @{"Print ..." LINK print}

  � @{"Load Config File" LINK loadconf}
  � @{"Save Config File" LINK loadconf}
  � @{"About" LINK About}
  � @{"Iconify" LINK Iconify}
  � @{"Quit" LINK Quit}

 Utilities menu
  Here you find some useful utilities  (not within the AIDE package).
  The corresponding  program  must  be in the right directory as men-
  tioned in the @{"installing section" LINK install},  or there  must  be  an entry in
  AIDE's @{"setup window" LINK setup}.
  Please note, that  AB2ASCII  is a little bit buggy.  If you want to
  improve it, well, do it!

    Calculator          -   Invokes the calculator

                            when  calling  shared  library functions.
                            The .bmap file is stored in the ACEbmaps:

                            A file requester for selection is invoked
                            and you can select only one, all,  or the

                            the filenames. AIDE handles that for you.
                            The converted file will have an _u exten-
                            sion to the filename.
    Utility 0 to 3      -   Here you have the possibility  to specify
                            any utility of your choice.  A correspon-
                            ding entry in AIDE2.config must exist!

                            You can only use tools,  which don't need
                            an argument  to run  (this may be changed
                            in a future release).

 Help menu
  This  menu  provides access to the documentation  for the compiler,
  SuperOptimizer, assembler and linker from within AIDE.
  In addition, access to the ACE Language Reference manual  ACE exam-
  ples, ACE history and this document can be gained via the Help menu.

  The Help function'll do nothing if no viewer at all is specified.

  All the supported doc files must be in your specified "Doc Dir".

    The supported docs are:

            AIDE.txt/AIDE.guide
            ACE.txt/ACE.guide
            SuperOptimizer.guide
            A68K.txt
            PhxAss.guide
            BLink.txt
            PhxLnk.guide

            ACEcalc.txt (/ACEcalc.guide if available)
            ReqEd.txt   (/ReqEd.guide if available)

    Note:
        The docs must exist under the names described above. AIDE re-
        lies on them.  If you have other docs, you can view them with
        the function @{"View" LINK View} from the "Project" menu in any case.
@endnode

@node Open "Open ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Open ...

 Invokes the  editor  with a  file name  which you must specify via a
 file requester.  If no file name is given, AIDE will inform you with
 a message.
 This option is included to edit any file of your choice. For editing
 the source file see below.  The current used dir will be remembered,
 so you don't have to switch to all the directories again.
@endnode

@node View "View ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 View ...

 Lets you view a file which is selected via a file requester.  Remem-
 bers the current dir.
@endnode

@node Rename "Rename ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Rename ...

 Lets you rename a file specified via a file requester. Remembers the
 current dir.
 First  a file requester  will be opened  where you have to select  a
 file,  which you want to rename. Now a second file requester appears
 where you have to select the new name.  You can change the directory
 name, too, so a rename has the same effect as "move a file". This is
 only possible for the same device.
@endnode

@node Copy "Copy ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Copy ...

 Lets you copy a file  specified via a file requester.  Remembers the
 current dir.
 There will be also two file requester:  the first one  to choose the
 source file,  the second one to choose the destination dir  and file
 name.  If you change the name for the destination file,  it will  be
 copied with the new name.
@endnode

@node Delete "Delete ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Delete ...

 Lets you delete a file specified via a file requester. Remembers the
 current dir.

 Note:
  No second requester will appear, asking, whether you really want to
  delete this file. You can't double click the filename.  You have to
  choose "OK" to perform the action.
@endnode

@node Print "Print ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Print ...

 Lets you choose a file to print via a file requester.  Remembers the
 current dir.

 Note:
  This function is very simple.  It uses your printer preferences, as
  setup via the prefs tool  from your workbench disk.  No page check-
  ing, no formatting, nothing else is done.
  The function prints files,  no matter which size,  when they can be
  loaded in memory.
  This may be more comfortable in a future release. ;-)
@endnode

@node Execute "Execute ... (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Execute ...

 Allows an AmigaDOS command to be executed. The command and its argu-
 ments are entered into an input requester, a console window is open-
 ed for any I/O associated with the command  and the latter is execu-
 ted if possible.
@endnode

@node spawnshell "Spawn Shell (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Spawn Shell

 A NewShell process  is started for more comprehensive  house-keeping
 tasks than the  @{"Execute ..." LINK execute}  option is intended for.  Your default
 settings as defined in S:Shell-Startup are used.
@endnode

@node loadconf "Load and Save Config File (Project Menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Load Config File & Save Config File

 You can create now multiple  config files.  With these two functions
 you can load/save now the default or any other config file.

 default:

 - will try to load/save a file named ACE:AIDE/AIDE2.config

 other:

 - will bring up a file requester where you can specify any directory
   and filename of your choice.

@endnode

@node About "About (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 @{"About" link finalcomments}

 Brings up a message box telling you briefly about AIDE.
@endnode

@node Iconify "Iconify (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Iconifiy

 AIDE does now allow you to close the main window and to have an app-
 icon on the workbench. To wake AIDE up you just have to double-click
 on the appicon.

 Note: To work properly, the AIDE icon (AIDE.info) must reside in the
       directory ACE:AIDE/. If this isn't the case, AIDE will use the
       default program icon  (as can be specified via  IconEdit)  for
       the appicon.
@endnode


@node Quit "Quit AIDE (Project menu)"
@TOC TOC

 Quit AIDE

 Exits  from  AIDE.  (You can also click the close gadget of the main
 window.)  Depending on the settings  @{"(see SetUp)" LINK setup}  you will be  asked
 whether you want to quit AIDE.
@endnode

@node Setup "Setup"
@TOC TOC

 Setup

 This is completely new, so you don't have to edit a config file out-
 side of AIDE. All the settings you change there will be active imme-
 diately (despite of one).

 Just one word to the default font setting:

 "Thinpaz.font" is used so all the gadgets will fit in a window which
 can be displayed on a standard NTSC screen.  For  those  who  use  a
 higher resolution of their  Workbench  screen,  the  option  "Public
 Screen" can be used.


 Directory Setup:

 Well, when you choose AIDE setup  the main window will be closed and
 the setup window will be opened.  On the left side there are all the
 string gadgets for the directory setup.  If  you  want to change the
 names manually  you can do it there.  If you type an error  the  old
 entry will be displayed again  and  the string gadget will be set to
 active state.
 When you select the "R" button  ("R" means requester),  right beside
 the string gadget,  an ASL file requester will pop up  where you can
 choose a directory or file name of your choice.

 Note:
  If only a directory is necessary for the setup a selected file name
  will be ignored.
  If no file name is selected where one is absolutely necessary, your
  choice will not be accepted.


 Other:

   Public Screen:
        Here you have the choice to define,  if AIDE should run on an
        own public screen.  This screen'll have "Shanghai" abilities.
        That means that all windows which would normally be opened on
        the Workbench screen,  will now be opened on the AIDE screen.
        The AIDE screen will close automatically  if the  AIDE window
        and all the visitor windows are closed.

        This is the only setting  which will  have effect,  when  you
        start  AIDE  again  after saving your config file  as default
        (AIDE2.config).

        This may be changed in a future release.

   Requester:
        Here you have the choice to define:
                All:    all requester will be displayed
                Error:  only error requester will be displayed
                Min:    only fatal error requester will be displayed!

        Just try it out and set this flag to your personal taste.

   Clean up:
        Here you have the choice to define:
                Yes:  This is the default setting and that means that
                      all the  temporary files  will be deleted  when
                      you quit AIDE.
                No:   If  you  select  this,  then no temporary files
                      will be deleted when you quit AIDE. That may be
                      useful  if  you  want  to have a look  at those
                      files later. Older versions of AIDE will always
                      delete those files.
                      Still, all temporary files will be deleted when
                      you perform a new compiler run.

                      Note:

                      ACE.err is now found in ACE:temp  and no longer
                      in ACE:AIDE.


   Menu Pen:
        Here  you can select the color of the menu pen  from  0 to 2.
        This may be useful  if you do not like the default setting of
        menu pen 0 (background color).

@node tooltypes "Icon Tooltypes"
@TOC TOC

 Icon Tooltypes

 You can configure AIDE now  via the tooltypes entry  of  the  source
 file icon and the AIDE program icon. The defined tooltypes are:

    FILETYPE    =   ACESource

                    If  you are  using  icons  for your source files,
                    this tooltype must be set  if you wish the source
                    file to be set within AIDE.

                    Note:
                    This entry is ignored  if set in the AIDE program
                    icon.


    CONFIGFILE  =   AIDE2.config or any other config file name you've
                    specified for this source file.


    PRECO       =   app or any other precompiler you want to use with
                    this source file (preferable NAP ;-).

                    Note:
                    An example source icon is in the AIDE archive.

@TOC TOC

 Source

    Set         - Lets you specify the ACE source file  to work with,
                  via a file requester.  Some gadgets are not access-
                  ible until this has been done for the first time.
                  The file requester for "Set Source..." starts up in
                  the directory  which  was  referenced the last time
                  option was invoked.
                  If the file selected does not exist, AIDE'll invoke
                  the editor.

    Reset       - Resets the current  source file  for a new compiler
                  run. Useful if you did invoke the editor outside of
                  AIDE.

    Edit        - Invokes the editor with the current source file  as
                  its  argument.  If  no  editor  is  specified, this
                  option will be disabled

@node program "The Program Section"
@TOC TOC

 Program

    Precompile  - This will invoke the specified precompiler with the
                  current source file as its argument.  No check,  if
                  the source file was already precompiled is done.

    Compile     - This will invoke ACE and the SuperOptimizer (if set
                  to active). No check if the source file was already
                  compiled is done.

    Assemble    - This will invoke the selected  assembler.  No check
                  if the source file was already assembled is done.

    Link        - This will invoke the selected linker.  No check  if
                  the source file was already linked is done.

    Run         - Runs the current program,  compiling  it  first  if
                  necessary.

                  Important:

                  This  functions  can now be used for  CLI programs,
                  too, but no input box will appear.  If you need  to
                  specify a command line argument  use "Run in Shell"
                  instead.  But if you do  not need  to enter command
                  line arguments,  this function will do now the same
                  task.

    Run in Shell- Runs the current program in a shell,  compiling  it
                  first if necessary. Before the program is run, AIDE
                  asks for command line arguments via an input box.
                  Supply no arguments  if none are required,  or  use
                  "Run" instead.

 Important:

  The buttons in the "Program" section will not change their state if
  you change any names/options for @{"precompiler" LINK precompiler},  @{"ACE" LINK aceoptions},  @{"assembler" LINK assembler},
  @{"linker lib" link linkerlib} or @{"linker" LINK linker} and the internal state of the  @{"make process" link makeproc}
  won't be affected either.

  If you did change the options just select the corresponding buttons
  in the "Program" section  to perform the missing steps of your com-
  pilation process.
  This habit differs completely  from older versions of AIDE.  It was
  done this way, so that the program is not recompiled completely, be-
  cause only the assembler or linker option had been changed.

  If you want to perform a new compiler run, just select "Reset" from
  the @{"source section" LINK source} and "Make Executable" or whatever AIDE should do
  for you.

@node make "The Make Section"
@TOC TOC

 Make

    Executable  - @{"Makes" LINK makeproc}  the  current  program,  putting all interme-
                  diate files and the  final executable program  into
                  the temporary working directory.

    Application - Does the same as "Make Executable"  but also copies
                  the  final  executable  from  temporary  storage to
                  ACE:Run. This is the default.
                  If the default is overwritten  with an empty entry,
                  the  executable  goes  to the root directory  where
                  AIDE resides.
                  An icon is also copied.  That  is  the  default for
                  "Make  Application".  You  don't  need  to  specify
                  "Create Icon" for the @{"ACE options" link aceoptions}.

    Module      - Creates an object module  which can later be linked
                  with any ACE program.  The only difference  between
                  this option and Make Executable (above) is  that no
                  linking occurs and ACE's -m switch is used. See al-
                  so  "Creating & using  ACE  subprogram modules"  in
                  ace.txt.
                  The  object module  goes to ACE:Mods (default),  or
                  where the entry in AIDE2.config points to.  If this
                  is empty,  the module goes to the  root  directory,
                  where AIDE resides.

                  The displayed module list  will be updated  if  the
                  entry point in your configuration is setup correct-
                  ly.

@node precompiler "The Precompiler Section"
@TOC TOC

 Precompiler

    The mutual exclusive buttons gives you the possibility  to choose
    APP, ACPP or any other precompiler  to be used to precompile your
    source file.

    If you select "other",  an  input box  will pop up  where you can
    enter the name of your desired precompiler.

    If  you  choose  DCPP  then  the options will be set up correctly
    to be used for ACE programs.  DCPP  is  much  faster  as ACPP and
    does the same task.

    I  recommend to use  NAP (guess why ;-) as it's almost as fast as
    ACPP  (and I hope it will be faster the next versions)  and  does
    the same task as ACPP and APP  together  (processing  defines,  C
    comments AND ACE comments!)

    If  no  precompiler  name  is  entered,  the  button of your last
    selected  one will be activated again and an existing precompiler
    name will be deleted.

    Clicking the close gadget of the window will ignore all  what you
    may have entered in the string gadget.  If  your  settings should
    take effect press <RETURN>.

    "List Source Lines" is not available via checkbox gadget,  if you
    need this, just enter "l" in the input box  after having selected
    "other"!

    Since  AIDE  always uses ACE's -E switch to create an error file,
    this option is not available.  Compilation  errors are,  however,
    viewable via "View Compiler Errors"!

    other  -  If you select this button  an input box will pop up and
              give you the  possibility  to enter any kind of ACE op-
              tion which may be defined new for the future.  Use this
              as well if you want to specify "list source line".

              You have to enter the options as defined in ACE.txt. If
              no "space" is required, then don't enter it.

              If you enter an empty string here all options which may

@node superopt "The SuperOptimizer Section"
@TOC TOC

 SuperOptimizer

 Here you can choose if you want to use the SuperOptimzer from Manuel
 Andre. With "Set Level" you can set the the superopt level.  A input
 box will pop up,  where you can enter the number.  Only numbers from
 1 to 12 are accepted. The default value is set to 12.

 Note:
  The SuperOptimizer is used in combination  with the make process of
  ACE.  If you did change the level  you have to recompile the source
  again with ACE using the "Compile" button.

  If you did switch off the Superoptimizer,  you don't have to recom-
  pile again, because the unoptimized file <name>.s  still exists and
  AIDE will use this one instead of <name>_opt.s.

  In a future release it might be possible to select the SuperOptimi-
  zer separately.

 PS:  Unfortunately Manuel Andre changed the way to specify the opti-
      mizing depth from numbers to letters. Until now it has not been
      possible to make AIDE working with that. Therefore, you'll have
      to use older versions of SuperOptimizer  which do still support
      the numbers.
      I hope to be able to find a way to support the newer version in
      the next versions of AIDE.

@node assembler "The Assembler Section"
@TOC TOC

 Assembler

 Here you can choose which assembler you like to use. A68K and PhxAss
 (see the corresponding doc files for more details) are fully suppor-
 ted from AIDE.

 Just  select  the  desired  options,  or  enter  new  ones  with the
 "Set Options"  buttons.  All what you enter  has to be done the same
 way  as if you would type them  at the Shell prompt.  For  A68K  and
 PhxAss the options are set in the right place of the command string.
 PhxAss is set to NULL  for optimizing the assembly output.  It does
 depend on your program  which optimizing options  you can use.  Read
 the docs carefully and try them.  Optimizing the assembly output re-
 sults in shorter/faster executables.

 When you specify another assembler  via the "other" button  then the
 options  will  be added  after the name of the file  which has to be
 assembled.

 Example:

  superassembler test.s ......... this is the default used name build
                                  out of the assembler name  and  the
                                  compiled source name.

  Then all what you did enter via the  "Set Option"  button  will  be
  added!  You have to specify an object file  name  "test.o"  if  the
  assembler needs it to create a linkable module.

  But be aware:

  If you did define options for  A68K and you switch to  PhxAss  then
  you have to delete those options first, otherwise they will be used
  also for PhxAss. This will result in an error message from PhxAss.

 Small Code/Small Data model:

  Please read the corresponding docs for the assemblers to this point
  very very carefully. Not all assemblers does the same task!!!
  Don't choose these options if you are not sure what they are doing.

 Debug Info:

  If you select this,  A68K or  PhxAss will create a symbol table for
  all the labels and variable names which exists in the .s file. This
  is especially helpful if also "Assembly Comment" is selected as ACE
  option.
  The compiled program  can then be watched  with a  symbol  debugger
  like MonAm. And you can compare it with your assembly source file.

@node linkerlib "The Linker Lib Section"
@TOC TOC

 Linker Lib

 Here you can choose  which linker lib despite of the defaults db.lib
 and startup.lib, which are linked always, should be used. For PhxLnk
 you can use the standard Amiga.lib instead of Ami.lib.

 Important:

 Blink will crash if you try to link Amiga.lib!!!!!!
@endnode


@node linker "The Linker Section"
@TOC TOC

 Linker

 Here you choose which linker you like to use.  BLink and  PhxLnk are
 fully supported by AIDE.

 What I did say about the handling of the "Set Options" button  above
 in the @{"assembler" LINK assembler} chapter is also valid for the linker part.  So read
 the linker docs carefully  if you want to use other options  as pre-
 defined in AIDE.


 SmallCode:

  If you choose this option  the supported linkers will link all your
  program code into one piece. This results in shorter executable but
  can't be "scattered loaded".  See, in any case,  the  corresponding
  linker docs files for the details.

 Small Data:

  This  has  the  same effect for the data section of your program as
  described above for the program section.


 Important:

  PhxLnk  links  all data sections  into  one piece, no matter if for
  some special ones the Chip mem bit is set!  This can result  in the
  effect that some machines are reporting "not enough memory" if they
  try to load a program  which was linked with PhxLnk  and this option
  set. That happens, because ACE creates large data sections  (depen-
  ding on the used amount of variables)  which  has  to  be loaded to
  Chip mem now.  Machines with  only 512k  and sometimes  those  with
  1Mega byte of chip mem, will report "not enough memory".

  PhxLnk has options to force Chip mem data sections to Chip mem  and
  all the other data sections to Fast mem,  but that  has to be  done
  inside of the assembler source file. :-(   This is not possible for
  normal :-) ACE programmers.  We only can hope that Klaus will be so
  kind to add an option to PhxLnk, so this'll be done automatically.

  Blink separates Chip mem data sections from the others,  so this'll
  not happen with BLink.

  In any case you should be aware, that this option only makes sense,
  if also the assembler option was set to SmallCode/Small Data. If it
  was not  (and ACE does not allow SmallCode/Small Data for  all your
  programs)  and SmallCode/Small Data option set for the linker only,
  results in programs  which can have  loading problems  on  machines
  with less memory and high memory fragmentation.

 No Debug Info:

  If you select this option  the program will be linked  ignoring all
  defined symbol table entries, if they exist.

@node module "The Module section"
@TOC TOC

 Module

 All SUBMods which resides in the specified "Module Dir" are display-
 ed in the main window.  Just click on the name to select the one you
 want to link and the chosen one will be highlighted.  Clicking on a
 selected entry results in unselecting it.  If you want to remove all
 modules just click on the button "Remove all Modules"

 There is  no limit  for the amount of Modules defined  which  can be
 linked.

 The amount is only limited  by the length of the  command  line  the
 linker accepts for input.  My testing did result in about 20 modules
 as maximum (depending on the length of the file name). The buffer of
 AIDE allows up to 120 modules until an error message is displayed.


 Note:

  No  checking  of  the  filename  is done,  only directory names are
  ignored.  Therefore  you can place  any type  of linkable file into
  your "Module Dir".
  If you want to link other linker libs as predefined just place them
  here and select them as described above.


 Note:

  If you want to save your option @{"settings" link setup} from the main window, use
  @{"Save Configuration" link loadconf}  from  the  @{"Project" link menu} menu.  All  your  settings
  will be saved in AIDE2.config (default)  or in another file  if you
  wish to do so.

@node makeproc "AIDE's Make Process"
@TOC TOC

 AIDE's "Make" Process

 As you may have gleaned from the above,  AIDE  has a simple  inbuilt
 "make" capability.

 This means that before it builds or makes an executable and prior to
 compiling or running a program,  AIDE checks to see whether compila-
 tion needs to take place at all.

 If you have created an executable  and then  decide to run it,  AIDE
 will not recompile the source first.  Likewise, if you want to build
 an executable and the program has already been compiled,  the execu-
 table will be copied from AIDE's temporary workspace only.

 In like manner,  if you have compiled a program  to produce  an ass-
 embly source file,  so long as you don't edit the  ACE source  file,
 AIDE will not recompile the program  before assembling  and  linking
 it.

 If you want to recompile select @{"Source Reset" link source} or do it step by step
 with the buttons in the @{"Program" link program} section.

 On the other hand if you edit a source file, next time you go to run
 it,  AIDE  will  "bring  the  program  up  to  date"  by  compiling,
 assembling and linking it first.

 If you  forgot  to link  some modules  just select them  and  select
 "Link" from the @{"Program" link program} section.

 In order to preprocess,  compile, assemble and link a program,  AIDE
 now uses the DOS function SystemTagList().  An intuition window will
 be opened to watch the progress  of your  compilation  run.  If  you
 select "Stop" there, the next step will not be taken. If you want to
 stop immediately you have to press Ctrl-C in the CON: window,  which
 was also opened to display the current output from ACE and the other
 programs.  But not all programs, used to make an executable,  accept
 Ctrl-C, therefore the "Stop" button was added.

 Note:

   Only the next step can be aborted via the  "Stop" button,  because
   SystemTagList() didn't return before and did give the control back
   to AIDE.

   PIPE: is not used anymore!

 If an error  or user break  occurs during preprocessing  or compila-
 tion, AIDE will stop and give the control back to the user.

 Well, Herbert never started a history so a long period is missing.
 Myself is also not that successful in keeping a history but I'll try
 my best :-)

     ??/??/??   Since the last release 2.07 and this one (v2.12) were
                some other versions, still by Herbert, which have not
                been published. (Some little bugs were removed.)
     >--------------------------------------------------------------<
     04/08/97   got source code of AIDE, started to go through to un-
                derstand what happens where and why and how and.. ;-)
     04/17/97   started to include iconization ability
     04/27/97   rewrote manual (AmigaGuide format)
     05/11/97   When loading a new configuration file via the menu it
                will now be checked whether the current configuration
                has changed.
